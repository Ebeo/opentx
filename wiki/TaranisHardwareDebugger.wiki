=== The Hardware you'll need ===

 * This board: STM32F4 DISCOVERY USB STM32F407VGT6 STM32 ARM Cortex-M4 Development Board (you will find it on [http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=151033382663 eBay])

 * These 1.25 plugs: Mini. Micro 1.25 T-1 4-Pin JST Connector w/.Wire x 10 sets (you will also find them on [ebay http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=181198791446#ht_3569wt_1031])

 * One 100 Ohms CMS resistor

 * One JWT 4 pins connector (I got them from [HobbyKing http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=29279])

 * The mini USB cable (the one you use to flash your radio everyday)


=== The Software you'll need === 

 * STM32 ST-LINK utility with the associated driver ([http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF258168 here ])

 * OpenOCD 0.7.0 (AndrÃ© prepared a beautiful zip for us here)


 * The GCC ARM toolchain ([https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download here])


=== Preparation === 

 * Solder the 100 Ohm resistor on the empty slot R2 of the discovery board

 * Solder the mini JST plug on the Taranis board here:

 * Prepare your cable according to this schema:

JTMS -> SWDIO
JTCK -> SWCLK
GND  -> GND
VCC  -> VDD

=== Installation ===

 * Install the STM32 ST-LINK utility, it will automatically install the driver for the board

 * Plug the board through the mini-usb cable. The board will be detected and the driver correctly setup

 * Start the STM32 ST-LINK utility, go in the ST-LINK menu and choose Firmware Update. Check that the board is correctly detected and start the update.

=== Start the debugging ===

 * Connect everything

 * Start a cmd window and launch OpenOCD with this script:
openocd-stlinkv2.bat

 * Start another cmd window, go inside the openTX src directory and launch gdb this way:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.7
 2013q3\bin\arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe" opentx.elf

 * Inside gdb:

{{{
target remote :3333
monitor reset
break perMain
cont
}}}

The program should stop in perMain

{{{
set unexpectedShutdown = 1
cont
}}}

You should now see the asterisk in the notification bar

{{{
set unexpectedShutdown = 0
cont
}}}

The asterisk should be removed now
