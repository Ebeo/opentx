=== [**all] ===
 * Expos and Mixes may belong to a list of Flight Phases (not only FPx and !FPx)
 * Limits may be "symetrical". I let Kilrah explain ;)
 * Many voice improvements (on all platforms). We now have en, it, fr and cz TTS voices
 * Mixer may use as sources "raw" inputs (sticks without any DR/Expos applied). I let Kilrah explain ...
 * DSM Range Check (thanks to Bryan from gruvin9x)
 * New Custom Switches functions: d>=ofs (means difference between 2 values >= ofs) and |d|>=ofs<br>Typical usage: you want to know the Batt value each time it decreases by 0.1V or the Altitude each time it changes by 10meters.
 * Trainer functions / Instant Trim now have a checkbox to easily enable / disable them
 * Inverting the throttle channel on limits screen now shows a popup warning for confirmation
 * Inactivity alarm more frequent again (every 5 secs)
 * PPM polarity display corrected, was inverted
 * Free EEPROM count corrected
 * Haptic feedback fixes
 * [**MENU long] on a switch in Function Switches screen toggles between normal and momentary switch (THR <=> THRm, !THR <=> !THRm)
 * Differential now have 1% steps instead of 2% steps
 * New DBLKEYS option, when editing parameters:
   * right/left => invert
   * up/down => reset
   * up/right => +100
   * down/left => -100
 * Trims don't stop for good when reaching the middle anymore, but just pause half a second
 * Power reading fixed when current source is A1 or A2
 * Templates fixed to take account of the new curve system
 * RSSI Tx and Rx before A1 and A2 in telemetry item list - *this is not updated automatically, PLEASE CHECK YOUR SETTINGS!*
 * Telemetry-based custom switches do not trigger anymore when no data is received
 * Trim handling fixed on mixes using curves and differential
 * AUTOSWITCH option now reflects switches' physical positions
 * Expo / DRs now allows for EITHER a curve OR an expo value, not both (saves memory, and expo can be replicated on the curve if needed).
